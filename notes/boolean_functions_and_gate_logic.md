# Constructing a boolean function from a truth table.

You construct a Disjunctive Normal Form formula ([video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/lecture/zJKs1/unit-1-2-boolean-functions-synthesis)).

### NOT represented with NAND

NOT(x) = NAND(x, x)

### AND represented with NAND

AND(x, y) = NOT(NAND(x, y))
