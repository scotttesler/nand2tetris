## Constructing a boolean function from a truth table.

You construct a Disjunctive Normal Form formula ([video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/lecture/zJKs1/unit-1-2-boolean-functions-synthesis)).

## NAND

Definition: (X NAND Y) = NOT(X AND Y)

### NOT represented with NAND

NOT(x) = (x NAND x)

### AND represented with NAND

(x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)
